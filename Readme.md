# Container Demo 

ContainerDemo is a very simple `platform as-a service` platform that runs any http docker image and then proxies it.
This is my hobby project that taught me a lot.

### How it works!

-   Firstly, We build any docker image for run.
-   And then, we should upload the image.
-   After, we should define a specification.yml (yaml because it's traditional :) )
-   Upload specifcation file.
-   Demo
